/*You are given an array of elements. Now you need to choose the best index of this 
array. An index of the array is called best if the special sum of this index is maximum 
across the special sum of all the other indices. To calculate the special sum for any 
index you pick the first element that is and add it to your sum. Now you pick next 
two elements i.e., and and add both of them to your sum. Now you will pick the 
next elements, and this continues till the index for which it is possible to pick the 
elements. Find the best index and in the output print its corresponding special sum. 
Note that there may be more than one best index, but you need to only print the 
maximum special sum.*/
